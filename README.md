  My original play through of Krastorio 2 was 140 hours, and I decided I needed to expand the grid from 1-2 trains to 1-8 and prove that simple circles are enough as intersections with the new train ai-pathing. Rather than deleting my entirebase I simply remade it in sandbox-mode.
  It took 60 hours to put it together after redesigned most of the core components, and the rest of the play-time has simply been idle-time or expanding mines. I incrementally increased science consuption to ensure integrity of system. The factory at this point plays itself.
  
  Feel free to leave it running for 24 hours. I assume copper mines will run out around the 20~ hour mark. Trains automatically move onto the next mine if the one they're on cannot satisfy them, and the factory is very copper hungry.
